# Owen and the Columbian Exchange

## The Project: 
This project uses RFID technology to demonstrate the Columbian Exchange. An RFID reader is hidden within the mouth of the papier-mache head, and "food" with hidden RFID tags get fed into the head's mouth. Each tag is programmed with a location - either Europe or the Americas - which lights up the corresponding light on the map background, to show where the food originated. 

## The Process: 
- We chose this project because we wanted to experiment with RFID tags. We found that RFID tags worked well with the interaction of feeding and started to brainstorm different ideas around that. We came up with the idea of the Columbian Exchange and feeding food to an explorer to find its origin. 
- We made a papier-mache head using a balloon and an aluminum can to shape the head and neck. Once it was dry, we painted the head to resemble a 16th century explorer. We named him Owen as an homage to Owen Wilson, because both of their noses are crooked. 
- The RFID reader we used was a Phidget that we then programmed using Processing. First, we programmed each unique tag to bring up a specific food item on the program display. We used the template that came with the Phidget Processing Library as a base.
