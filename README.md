# Owen and the Columbian Exchange

## The Project: 
This project uses RFID technology to demonstrate the Columbian Exchange. An RFID reader is hidden within the mouth of the papier-mache head, and "food" with hidden RFID tags get fed into the head's mouth. Each tag is programmed with a location - either Europe or the Americas - which lights up the corresponding light on the map background, to show where the food originated. 

## The Process: 
- We chose this project because we wanted to experiment with RFID tags. We found that RFID tags worked well with the interaction of feeding and started to brainstorm different ideas around that. We came up with the idea of the Columbian Exchange and feeding food to an explorer to find its origin. 
- We made a papier-mache head using a balloon and an aluminum can to shape the head and neck. Once it was dry, we painted the head to resemble a 16th century explorer. We named him Owen as an homage to Owen Wilson, because both of their noses are crooked. His second name, Miguel, is an homage to the character from "The Road to El Dorado." 
- The RFID reader we used was a Phidget that we then programmed using Processing. First, we programmed each unique tag to bring up a specific food item on the program display. We used the template that came with the Phidget Processing Library as a base. 
- We then attached a second Phidget, that was an InterfaceKit that had two LED lights. We added to our processing code so that two of the food items (e.g. the potato and the turkey from the Americas) would trigger one light and the other two would trigger the second light. vvdsdvsd
- To display the project we chose to test out vinyl cutting to present the continents that were a part of the Columbian Exchange we were focusing on. We worked with Adobe Illustrator to create a vector outline of a map with the Americas, Europe, and Africa. (Side note: We realized, while making this map, how eurocentric this project was. We decided to address this in the wording on the text panels.) 
- We used a Roland STIKA SV-12 Desktop Cutter for the cutouts. It turned out that the cutter was not easily compatible with MACs and the Illustrator file on its own, so we learned how to use Roland's software CutStudio. With that we were able to make verynice gold vinyl cutouts of the continents. 
- We set up a cardboard box lid to function as the display for the head. We cut a hole out of the middle for the head to rest in. 
- We also cut a hole in the back of the head as well so that the RFID reader and the cords attaching it to the computer would have a place to rest. We also cut a hole in the 
- Next, it was covered in black posterpaper, so that the gold vinyl would pop. 
- We poked a hole on either side of the box for the LED lights to sit in and be visible when lit up. If we were to make another version of this project we would try place the LED lights more clearly associated with each continent, as the current placement above the countries looks a little lost.
- We wrote simple text panels to convey the instructions and information about the Columbian Exchange. 

## The Results:
Overall, we were quite pleased with how the project turned out. It's a fun and educational project that quickly demonstrates how the Columbian Exchange works. With more time and resources, we would be able to make a more polished and functional display. One that looks a little less like a high school science project. It was great to apply the skills and knowledge we had learned throughout the semester on Processing, Phidgets, and vinyl cutting.
